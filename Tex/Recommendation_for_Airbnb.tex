% This example file demonstrates the use of the 'sig-alternate.cls'
% V2.5 LaTeX2e document class file. It is for those submitting
% articles to ACM Conference Proceedings WHO DO NOT WISH TO
% STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE SIGS (PUBS-BOARD-ENDORSED) STYLE.
% The 'sig-alternate.cls' file will produce a similar-looking,

%
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% This .tex file (and associated .cls V2.5) produces:
%       1) The Permission Statement
%       2) The Conference (location) Info information
%       3) The Copyright Line with ACM data
%       4) NO page numbers
%
% as against the acm_proc_article-sp.cls file which

%
% Using 'sig-alternate.cls' you have control, however, from within
% the source .tex file, over both the CopyrightYear
% (defaulted to 200X) and the ACM Copyright Data
% (defaulted to X-XXXXX-XX-X/XX/XX).
% e.g.

% You need the command \numberofauthors to handle the 'placement
% and alignment' of the authors beneath the title.
%
% For aesthetic reasons, we recommend 'three authors at a time'
% i.e. three 'name/affiliation blocks' be placed beneath the title.
%
% NOTE: You are NOT restricted in how many 'rows' of
% "name/affiliations" may appear. We just ask that you restrict
% the number of 'columns' to three.
%
% Because of the available 'opening page real-estate'
% we ask you to refrain from putting more than six authors
% (two rows with three columns) beneath the article title.
% More than six makes the first-page appear very cluttered indeed.
%
% Use the \alignauthor commands to handle the names
% and affiliations for an 'aesthetic maximum' of six authors.
% Add names, affiliations, addresses for
% the seventh etc. author(s) as the argument for the

\begin{abstract}
Airbnb has become more and more popular under the trend of sharing economy. In order to attract new users to place their first booking on Airbnb and offer a more personalized experience, we aim to build a recommendation system by using collaborative filtering approach, to predict which country these new users will make their first booking. Also the hosting data for various countries will be analyzed to provide better insight around booking area.

\section{Introduction}
Data mining is the process of discovering interesting patterns from massive amounts of data. As a knowledge discovery process, it typically involves data cleaning, data integration, data selection, data transformation, pattern discovery, pattern evaluation, and knowledge presentation [1]. The science of learning plays a key role in the fields of data mining, statistics and artificial intelligence, intersecting with areas of engineering and other disciplines[2].  In a typical scenario, a quantitative or categorical outcome measurement is predicted based on a set of features.

Recommendation algorithms are a kind of learning algorithms which are widely used on e-commerce web sites.  they use input about a customer's interests to generate a list of recommended items. Most recommendation algorithms are designed for finding similar customers, where they aggregate items from the similar customers, eliminates items the user has already purchased or rated, and recommends the remaining items to the user. The popular versions of these algorithms are collaborative filtering and cluster models. In the collaborative filtering, the similarity of customers is measured by the cosine of the angle between the two vectors which represent users' interests[3]. Using this algorithm to generate recommendations is computationally expensive, but it can be released by dimensionally reduction techniques[4]. To find the similar customers to the user, cluster models divide the customer base into many segments and treat the task as a classification problem[5].  Some algorithms classify users into multiple segments and describe the strength of each relationship[6]. Besides grouping the user to the similar customers, other algorithms such as search-based methods and item-to-item collaborative filtering focus on finding similar items[7]. Search- or content-based methods treat the recommendations problem as a search for related items[8].

User experience is now a critical factor to keep users and attract new users among web applications. That is the reason Airbnb wants to provide personalized and unique experience for its new users, thus Airbnb need an effective recommendation system to recommend a country for first-time booking.

However, the main challenge here is that Airbnb doesn't have the travel history or other type of the traveling data of new users, the only data available here is basic feature such as age, gender, session log etc., basically like a white paper to a recommendation system. While a typical recommendation system might make recommendation based on a few strongly related features, the system designed here need to focus on correctly classify similar users first, then trying to make recommendation with some relatively strong features. And that is why we choose collaborative filtering as our first-step approach.

\section{Dataset Description}
\subsection{New user data set}
The training data consists of 213451 rows and 16 columns, while test user set has 62096 rows and 15 columns. The additional column is a 'country\_destination column', and this is where our predictions will be focused on.

About 60\% of the users did not making a making (NDF:no destination found). US is the most popular destination among who booked a travel destination.

\begin{figure}

\includegraphics[height=2in, width=3in]{1}
\caption{Destination Country Distribution.}
\end{figure}

Quite a few age values are given in the year format. For now we ignore the null values and inconsistent values, and the corrected data will be presented in the next update.

\begin{table}
\centering
\caption{User Age Statistics}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|l|} \hline
Minimum & 1.00\\ \hline
1st Quartile & 28.00 \\ \hline
Median & 34.00 \\ \hline
Mean & 37.41 \\ \hline
3rd Quartile & 43.00 \\ \hlineg
Maximum & 150.00 \\
\hline\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[height=2in, width=3in]{2}
\caption{Age Distribution for Users on Airbnb}
\end{figure}

Compared to basic sign-up and Facebook sign up users, those who signed up via Google have a much lower tendency to book a trip to U.S.

\begin{figure}

\includegraphics[height=2in, width=2in]{3}
\caption{Destination Choice ~ Sign Up Method}

\end{figure}

The differences between genders on destination country choices are not significant. It might be hard to generate any useful conclusion based on gender.

\begin{figure}

\includegraphics[height=2in, width=2in]{4}

\subsection{Listing data set}
The other data set is about detailed information of host listings among 16 countries available on Airbnb, although it covers almost all the countries in new user data set, but PT(Portugal) listing data is missing here.

This listing data set contains most of the public information available on Airbnb, and lots of features such as listing price, listing rating score, host registration information and neighbourhood etc., may help recommendation system identify better listings among target country for new users. However, due to the limitation of new user data, the recommendation on this part is most likely to be based on features weighted by common sense: highest rated, best available price etc..

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[height=2in, width=3in]{country-avgPrice}
\caption{Average price distribution among countries}
\end{figure}

Since listing price is showed in dollar, so the average listing price distribution is influenced by currency exchange rate in some extent, but besides that fact, the average listing price definitely reflects the popularity of these destination countries. BM(Bermuda) is a typical high-end vacation hot spot, but it's surprised to see UY(Uruguay) has such a high average price, maybe because the retrived UY listings is very limited. Other than these two countries, AU and US are the most expensive countries to go on Airbnb. It's interesting to see AU has higher average listing price over US, a possible explaination for this could be the number of listings in US is much greater than AU's, thus competetion over the host has lowered the average listing price in US.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[height=2in, width=3in]{country-avgRating}
\caption{Average rating score distribution among countries}
\end{figure}

When comes to average review scores, most of countries get over score of 90. BM, UY and VU receives average score of 100, but since the number of listing of these 3 countries in this data set is very limited, it probably has large bias here. Besides these 3 countries, US and NL is probably best reviewed place to go on Airbnb, IT and ES is the worst reviewed, but still has average score of over 89.

\section{Proposed Algorithmic Approach}
Using collaborative filtering to aggregate the similar users based on their first booking on Airbnb. The similarity between users is measured by cosine of the angle between the two vectors which indicate users? properties. Dimensionality reduction should be applied to reduce computational complexity and speed up the algorithm.
